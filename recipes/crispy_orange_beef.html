        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup long grain rice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons frozen orange juice concentrate</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups oil for frying</li>
        <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons orange zest</li>
        <li>8 broccoli florets, lightly steamed or blanched</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay beef in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Allow to dry in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring water and rice to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix together sugar, rice vinegar, orange juice concentrate, soy sauce, and salt in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Toss dried beef in cornstarch to coat. Fry coated beef in hot oil in small batches until crispy and golden brown; set aside. Drain oil from the wok, leaving about 1 tablespoon.</li>
        <li>Add ginger, garlic, and orange zest to remaining oil in wok. Cook and stir briefly until fragrant. Pour in soy sauce mixture; bring to a boil and cook until thick and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Stir in fried beef and cook until heated through. Serve hot over steamed rice and garnish with broccoli.</li>
